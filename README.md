# libgopro

Hello there, thanks for dropping by. `libgopro` is a work in progress.

It enables you to write applications that control
[GoPro](http://gopro.com/) Hero cameras (tested with a Hero 3+ until now).

For a first, working example program, see [`/examples`](./tree/master/examples).
It requires [libcurl](https://github.com/bagder/curl) to be present on your
system (which should be the case for most *nix systems including Mac OS).
